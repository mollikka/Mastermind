#Mastermind

This is a simple CLI version of the traditional game: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)

The CLI interface is in the file mastermind.py,
and the game logic is in mastermind_core.py

To run:
```
python mastermind.py
```

This thing only exists because I wanted to play some Mastermind.
